# Pokemon Data Collection - Easy and Hard Modes

## Overview
This project involves collecting and processing data about Pokémon using two distinct approaches:

1. **Easy Mode:**
   - Data is downloaded from a provided CSV link.
   - The data includes multiple attributes such as stats, abilities, and evolution status.
   - The data is processed and stored in a SQLite database (`pokemon.db`).
   - Table: `Pokemon`
   - Columns: `NUMBER`, `CODE`, `SERIAL`, `NAME`, `TYPE1`, `TYPE2`, `COLOR`, `ABILITY1`, `ABILITY2`, `ABILITY HIDDEN`, `GENERATION`, `LEGENDARY`, `MEGA_EVOLUTION`, `HEIGHT`, `WEIGHT`, `HP`, `ATK`, `DEF`, `SP_ATK`, `SP_DEF`, `SPD`, `TOTAL`

2. **Hard Mode:**
   - Data is scraped from Bulbapedia using BeautifulSoup.
   - The structure is intentionally minimal due to limited data available on the page.
   - Only `ID`, `Name`, `Type1`, and `Type2` are collected.
   - The data is stored separately in a new SQLite database (`pokemon_scraped.db`).
   - Table: `Pokemon_Scraped`
   - Columns: `ID`, `Name`, `Type1`, `Type2`

## Why the Differences in Data Structure?
- The Easy Mode dataset provides extensive data, including stats, abilities, and evolutionary data, which are not available on the Bulbapedia page scraped in Hard Mode.
- Therefore, the Hard Mode data structure is minimal, focusing only on `ID`, `Name`, `Type1`, and `Type2`.

## Directory Structure:
```
/pokemon_analysis/
│── easy_mode.py        # Easy Mode script
│── hard_mode.py        # Hard Mode script
│── data/
│   ├── pokemon_data.csv  # CSV from Easy Mode
│   └── scraped_data.csv  # CSV from Hard Mode
│── db/
│   ├── pokemon.db        # Database for Easy Mode
│   └── pokemon_scraped.db # Database for Hard Mode
│── README.md
```

## Data Handling and Inconsistencies:
- During Easy Mode data processing, a discrepancy was identified in line 1043 of the dataset, containing 29 columns instead of the expected 22 columns.
- To handle this, the script uses `on_bad_lines='skip'` to skip problematic lines and proceed with data processing.
- In Hard Mode, data structure is minimal due to limited data availability on the scraped page.

## Dependencies:
- `requests`
- `pandas`
- `sqlite3`
- `beautifulsoup4`

Install dependencies:
```
pip install requests pandas beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage:
1. Ensure the required libraries are installed.
2. Run Easy Mode script:
```
python easy_mode.py
```
3. Run Hard Mode script:
```
python hard_mode.py
```
4. Check the data in the respective databases:
   - `pokemon.db` for Easy Mode
   - `pokemon_scraped.db` for Hard Mode

## Important Notes:
- Hard Mode data structure is limited due to restricted data availability on the Bulbapedia page. Only `ID`, `Name`, `Type1`, and `Type2` are collected.
- Additional attributes like stats, abilities, and evolutionary data are not available in Hard Mode.
